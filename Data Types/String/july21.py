Data types are

#Integer
# String
# List
# Dictionary
# Set
# None

Integers are

Integers are any whole number either positive or negetive
example of integers are: 1 -1 3 -3 5 -10 etc

Variables are name given to a data 
example we assign the name Kim to the data 5
so anywhere we see Kim we mean 5

Good variables names in python are
Mustapha
Kim
Classs
x1
r

Bad variables in python are
Class
foo.d 
Lap-top
r+r
x.1

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. These are the arithmetic symbols
example of assignment operators are
=
+=
-=
*=
/=

Arithmetic operators are the well known operators in mathematics these are:
